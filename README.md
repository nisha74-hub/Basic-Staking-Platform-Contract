# P2P Betting Platform

## Project Title
**Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Betting Platform**

## Project Description

The P2P Betting Platform is a decentralized smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain that enables users to create, accept, and resolve peer-to-peer bets in a trustless environment. The platform eliminates the need for intermediaries by using smart contract technology to handle escrow, payouts, and dispute resolution automatically.

### Key Features

- **Create Custom Bets**: Users can create bets with custom descriptions, amounts, and expiration times
- **Accept Open Bets**: Browse and accept bets created by other users
- **Automatic Escrow**: Smart contract holds funds securely until bet resolution
- **Platform Fee System**: Small fee (2.5% default) collected on winning payouts
- **User Statistics**: Track betting history, win rates, and total winnings
- **Bet Expiration**: Automatic cancellation of unaccepted bets after expiration
- **Admin Controls**: Platform fee management and emergency functions
- **Transparent Resolution**: All bet outcomes are recorded on-chain

### How It Works

1. **Bet Creation**: A user creates a bet by depositing STX tokens and setting bet parameters
2. **Bet Acceptance**: Another user can accept the bet by matching the stake
3. **Escrow Management**: The contract holds both users' funds in escrow
4. **Resolution**: The contract owner resolves the bet based on the outcome
5. **Payout**: Winner receives the total pot minus platform fees
6. **Statistics Update**: User stats are automatically updated

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a fully decentralized, transparent, and fair betting ecosystem that:

- **Eliminates Trust Issues**: No need to trust centralized platforms or opponents
- **Ensures Fair Play**: Smart contract logic prevents manipulation and ensures automatic payouts
